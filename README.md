in my project the I install the vite react, Gsap and Axios. 

installation:
vite => npm create vite@latest then name your file, choose your programing language (JavaScript). then cd file_name, npm install. the last npm run dev.

Gsap => npm gsap

Axios => npm axios #I don't use it# (I what to use the Axios for shelters but because have error in the .map so I change to use array directly in the jsx)

for the YouTube video I don't know what happens the video can't show up I already use iframe but it still didn't work so I just managed the width and height.
